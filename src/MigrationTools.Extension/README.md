The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the  [documentation](http://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a [Azure DevOps Migration Tools on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/).

## What can you do with this tool?

- Migrate `Work Items`, `TestPlans & Suits`, `Teams`, `Shared Queries`, `Pipelines`, & `Processes` from one `Team Project` to another
- Migrate `Work Items`, `TestPlans & Suits`, `Teams`, `Shared Queries`, `Pipelines`, & `Processes` from one `Organisation` to another
- Bulk edit of `Work Items` accross an entire `Project`.

**WARNING: This tool is not designed for a novice. This tool was developed to support the scenarios below, and the edge cases that have been encountered by the 30+ contributors from around the Azure DevOps community. You should be comfortable with the TFS/Azure DevOps object model, as well as debugging code in Visual Studio.**
**Community support is available through [GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/discussions) ; Paid support is available through our [recommended consultants](http://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools/#support) as well as our contributors and many DevOps consultants around the world.**

### What versions of Azure DevOps & TFS do you support?

- Work Item Migration Supports all versions of TFS 2013+ and all versions of Azure DevOps
- You can move from any Tfs/AzureDevOps source to any Tfs/AzureDevOps target.
- Process Template migration only supports XML based Projects

### Typical Uses of this tool

- Merge many projects into a single project
- Split one project into many projects
- Assistance in changing Process Templates
- Bulk edit of Work Items
- Migration of Test Suites & Test Plans
- _new_ Migration of Builds & Pipelines
- Migrate from one Language version of TFS / Azure Devops to another (*new v9.0*)
- _new_  Migration of Processes

**NOTE: If you are able to migrate your entire Collection to Azure DevOps Services you should use [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/migrate/) from Microsoft. If you have a requirement to change Process Template then you will need to do that before you move to Azure DevOps Services.**

## Change Log

- v11.11 - Refactored revision manager to have more tests and support limiting the number of revisions. CollapseRevisions has been replaced by setting MaxRevisions to 1 and setting AttachRevisionHistory to true; MaxRevisions sets the maximum number of revisions that will be migrated. "First + Last*N = Max". If this was set to 5 and there were 10 revisions you would get the first 1 (creation) and the latest 4 migrated. This is done after all of the existing revisions are created but before anything newer that target is removed.
- v11.10 - Added ability to limit the number of revisions migrated with `MaxRevisions` on `WorkItemMigration` processor. 0 = All, and any other number should migrate the first revision + the latest up to MAX.
- v11.9 - Dark launch of `Process` migration by @akanieski 
- v11.9 - Dark launch of `Pipelines` & `Builds` migration by @tomfrenzel
- v11.8 - As part of moving to the new architecture we moved to default newtonsoft type handling with `$type` properties instead of `ObjectType` ___To Migrate rename "ObjectType" to "$type" in your configuration!___
- v11.5 - Added more useful logging levels. Replace `"TelemetryEnableTrace": false` with `"LogLevel": "Verbose"` in the config. Verbose will only be logged to the logfile.
- v11.2.1 - Removed NodeMigrationContext and converted it to an enricher for Work Items. Still needs work, so that it migrates individual nodes, but currently migrates all.
- v10.1 - Changed config design to have only the Name and not FullName of the class. Remove `MigrationTools.Core.Configuration.FieldMap.` and `MigrationTools.Core.Configuration.Processing.` from the config leaving only the Name of the class in ObjectType field.
- v10.0 - Start of the great refactor over to .NET Core and the REST API as the Object Model has been retired.
- v9.0 - Added support for migration between other language versions of Azure DevOps. Developed for German -> English
- v8.9 - Added 'Collapse Revisions' feature to collapse and attache revisions instead of replaying them
- v8.8 - 'SkipToFinalRevisedWorkItemType' feature added to handle scenario when changing Work Item Type
- v8.7 - Support for inline images using a Personal Access Token added to the Source Project
- v8.6 - Support for fixing links from TFVC Changesets to Git Commits using a mapping file generated from a Git-TFS migration.
- v8.5 - Attachment Max size and linking work items to git repos between projects.
- v8.4 - Support for cross-project linking of work items between projects.
- v8.3 - Support for restarting the migration and syncing at the revision level.
- v8.2 - Merge Git commit Fixing into Work Item migration (requires repos to be migrated first, can be rerun)
- v8.0 - Merge of Work Item, Link, & attachment migrators into one.
