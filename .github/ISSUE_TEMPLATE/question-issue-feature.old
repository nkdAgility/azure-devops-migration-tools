## I have completed the following:

- [ ] **Enable Debug in the Logfile** - You can set ` "LogLevel": "Debug"` in the configuration file which will output more information to the log. 
- [ ] **Please specify the Source and Target environments above** - Which versions are you migrating from/to Azure DevOps Server 2019, Azure DevOps Services,  TFS 20xx.
- [ ] **Attach the full Logfile from your last run** - You can obtuse any of the data that you want, but it's really helpful to have the full log to see what lead up to the issue. _Do not copy and paste the entire log in here! Attach the file to the issue!_
- [ ] **Attach the full Configuration file** - You can obtuse any of the data that you want, but it's really helpful to have the full config. _Do not copy and paste the entire log in here! Attach the file to the issue!_

__Many issues are due to edge cases and will need debugging in Visual Studio; we cant do that for you on your environment.__
