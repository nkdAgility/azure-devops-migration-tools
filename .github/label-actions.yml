    **Please create a GitHub Discussion instead of this issue.**


    As this issue has been labeled as `needs-discussion` by a maintainer it is being automatically closed and locked. It will later be deleted to avoid polluting repository searches with duplicate or incorrect content.


    This doesn't necessarily mean that what you've reported isn't a problem or a reasonable idea, but it does mean that it should be raised as a Discussion first and not an Issue. _Please create a Discussion now, assuming you still wish to discuss it._


    Thanks, Azure DevOps Migration Tools team

    Hi, you need to format code or logs here so that they're more readable for others.


    You can find a Markdown code formatting guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) as well as some GitHub-specific information formatting code blocks [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).


    Thanks, Azure DevOps Migration Tools team
