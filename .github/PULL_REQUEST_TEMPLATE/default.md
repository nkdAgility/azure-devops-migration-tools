## Things to be aware of

- **Logging uses serilog** - All Logging should be in the format `"My message that contains {item} and {item2}", item, itesm2`! Do not use `$"My message that contains {item} and {item2}"` to pass text into the log strings as this disables [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)'s ability to pass that data as telemetry to Application Insights and for log highlighting.
