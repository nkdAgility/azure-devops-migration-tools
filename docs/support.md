### Professional Support

You can get free support from the community above and on social media on a best effort basis if folks are available. If you are *looking for paid support* [naked Agility with Martin Hinshelwood & Co](https://nkdagility.com) has a number of experts, many of whom contribute to this project, that can help. Find out how [we can help you](https://nkdagility.com/technical-consulting-and-coaching/azure-devops-migration-tools-consulting/) with your migration and [book a free consultation](https://nkdagility.com/technical-consulting-and-coaching/azure-devops-migration-tools-consulting/) to discuss how we can make things easier.

We use these tools with our customers, and for fun, to do real world migrations on a daily basis and we can:

 - Consult with your internal folks who need help and guidance in running the tooling.
 - Make changes to the tool to support your needs; all additions are committed to the main repo.
 - Run the migration for you:- you would need to pay for the hours that we would spend baby-sitting the running migrations
