>**_This documentation is for a preview version of the Azure DevOps Migration Tools._ If you are not using the preview version then please head over to the main [documentation](https://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools).**


[Overview](.././index.md) > **Reference**

The system works by setting one or more [Processors](../v1/Processors/index.md) in the json 
configuration file. You can configure one or more [FieldMaps](../v1/FieldMaps/index.md) to 
manipulate the data during a migration.

### What types of things do we have

- **[Processors](../v1/Processors/index.md)** - Processors allow you to move different types of data between `Endpoints` and does not care what `Endpoint` you have on each end.
- **[FieldMaps](../v1/FieldMaps/index.md)** -
