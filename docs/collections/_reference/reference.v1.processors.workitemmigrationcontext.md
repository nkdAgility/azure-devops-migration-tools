    ## <a name="WIQLQueryBits"></a>WIQL Query Bits


    The Work Item queries are all built using Work Item [Query Language (WIQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax).


    > Note: A useful Azure DevOps Extension to explore WIQL is the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor)


    ### Examples


    You can use the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor) to craft a query in Azure DevOps.


    Typical way that queries are built:


    ```
     var targetQuery =
         string.Format(
             @"SELECT [System.Id], [{ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName}] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @TeamProject {WIQLQueryBit} ORDER BY {WIQLOrderBit}",
             Engine.Target.Config.ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName,
             _config.WIQLQueryBit,
             _config.WIQLOrderBit
          );
    var targetFoundItems = Engine.Target.WorkItems.GetWorkItems(targetQuery);

    ```


    A simple example config:


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```

    Scope to Area Path (Team data):


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.ChangedDate] > 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```

    ## More Complex Team Migrations

    The above options allow you to bring over a sub-set of the WIs (using the `WIQLQueryBit`) and move their area or iteration path to a default location. However you may wish to do something more complex e.g. re-map the team structure. This can be done with addition of a `FieldMaps` block to configuration in addition to the `NodeBasePaths`.


    Using the above sample structure, if you wanted to map the source project `Team 1`  to target project `Team A` etc. you could add the field map as follows


    A complete list of [FieldMaps](../Reference/v1/FieldMaps/index.md) are available.


    ```
     "FieldMaps": [
       {
          "$type": "FieldValueMapConfig",
          "WorkItemTypeName": "*",
          "sourceField": "System.AreaPath",
          "targetField": "System.AreaPath",
          "defaultValue": "TargetProg",
          "valueMapping": {
            "SampleProj\\Team 1": "TargetProg\\Team A",
            "SampleProj\\Team 2": "TargetProg\\Team B"
            "SampleProj\\Team 3": "TargetProg\\Team C"
          }
        },
      ],

    ```


    > Note: This mappings could also be achieved with other forms of Field mapper e.g. `RegexFieldMapConfig`, but the value mapper as an example is easy to understand

    The `WorkItemMigrationContext` processor is used for migrating work items from one Azure DevOps instance to another. This encompasses a variety of activities:


    1. **Transferring Work Items Between Instances**: The primary purpose of the processor is to transfer work items, including bugs, tasks, user stories, features, and more, from one Azure DevOps instance to another.


    2. **Migrating Work Item History**: The processor can also replicate the entire revision history of work items, providing continuity and maintaining a record of changes.


    3. **Migrating Attachments and Links**: The processor can transfer any attachments or links associated with work items. This includes both external links and internal links to other work items.


    4. **Updating Metadata**: If configured, the processor can update the "Created Date" and "Created By" fields on migrated work items to match the original items in the source instance.


    5. **Filtering Work Items**: The processor can be configured to only migrate certain work items based on their area or iteration paths.


    Overall, the `WorkItemMigrationContext` processor is a comprehensive tool for transferring work items and their associated data and metadata between Azure DevOps instances. It should be used whenever there is a need to move work items between instances while preserving as much information as possible.
