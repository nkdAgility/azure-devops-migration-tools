    ## <a name="WIQLQueryBits"></a>WIQL Query Bits


    The Work Item queries are all built using Work Item [Query Language (WIQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax).


    > Note: A useful Azure DevOps Extension to explore WIQL is the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor)


    ### Examples


    You can use the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor) to craft a query in Azure DevOps.


    Typical way that queries are built:


    ```
     var targetQuery =
         string.Format(
             @"SELECT [System.Id], [{ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName}] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @TeamProject {WIQLQueryBit} ORDER BY {WIQLOrderBit}",
             Engine.Target.Config.ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName,
             _config.WIQLQueryBit,
             _config.WIQLOrderBit
          );
    var targetFoundItems = Engine.Target.WorkItems.GetWorkItems(targetQuery);

    ```


    A simple example config:


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```

    Scope to Area Path (Team data):


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```


    ```

    "WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.ChangedDate] > 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",

    "WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",

    ```


    ## <a name="NodeBasePath"></a>NodeBasePath Configuration ##

    The `NodeBasePaths` entry allows the filtering of the nodes to be replicated on the target projects. To try to explain the correct usage let us assume that we have a source team project `SourceProj` with the following node structures


    - AreaPath
       - SourceProj
       - SourceProj\Team 1
       - SourceProj\Team 2
       - SourceProj\Team 2\Sub-Area
       - SourceProj\Team 3
    - IterationPath
       - SourceProj
       - SourceProj\Sprint 1
       - SourceProj\Sprint 2
       - SourceProj\Sprint 2\Sub-Iteration
       - SourceProj\Sprint 3

    Depending upon what node structures you wish to migrate you would need the following settings. Exclusions are also possible by prefixing a path with an exclamation mark `!`. Example are


    | | |

    |-|-|

    | Intention    | Migrate all areas and iterations and all Work Items

    | NodeBasePath | `[]`

    | Comment      | The same AreaPath and Iteration Paths are created on the target as on the source. Hence, all migrated WI remain in their existing area and iteration paths

    ||

    | Intention    | Only migrate area path `Team 2` and it associated Work Items, but all iteration paths

    | NodeBasePath | `["Team 2", "Sprint"]`

    | Comment      | Only the area path ending `Team 2` will be migrated. <br>The `WIQLQueryBit` should be edited to limit the WI migrated to this area path e.g. add `AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'SampleProject\\Team 2'` . <br> The migrated WI will have an area path of `TargetProj\Team 2` but retain their iteration paths matching the sprint name on the source

    ||

    | Intention    | Only migrate iterations structure

    | NodeBasePath | `["Sprint"]`

    | Comment      | Only the area path ending `Team 2` will be migrated<br>All the iteration paths will be migrated. <br> The migrated WI will have the default area path of `TargetProj` as their source area path was not migrated i.e. `TargetProj`<br> The migrated WI will have an iteration path match the sprint name on the source

    ||

    | Intention    | Move all WI to the existing area and iteration paths on the targetProj

    | NodeBasePath | `["DUMMY VALUE"]`

    | Comment      | As the `NodeBasePath` does not match any source area or iteration path no nodes are migrated. <br>Migrated WI will be assigned to any matching area or iteration paths. If no matching ones can be found they will default to the respective root values

    ||

    | Intention    | Move the `Team 2` area, but not its `Sub-Area`

    | NodeBasePath | `["Team 2", "!Team 2\\SubArea"]`

    | Comment      | The Work Items will have to be restricted to the right areas, e.g. with `AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'SampleProject\\Team 2' AND [System.AreaPath] NOT UNDER 'SampleProject\\Team 2\\Sub-Area'`, otherwise their migratin will fail


    # Iteration Maps and Area Maps


    These two configuration elements apply after the `NodeBasePaths` selector, i.e.

    only on Areas and Iterations that have been selected for migration. They allow

    to change the area path, respectively the iteration path, of migrated work items.


    These remapping rules are applied both while creating path nodes in the target

    project and when migrating work items.


    These remapping rules are applied with a higher priority than the

    `PrefixProjectToNodes` option. This means that if no declared rule matches the

    path and the `PrefixProjectToNodes` option is enabled, then the old behavior is

    used.


    The syntax is a dictionary of regular expressions and the replacement text.


    *Warning*: These follow the

    [.net regular expression language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

    The key in the dictionary is a regular expression search pattern, while the

    value is a regular expression replacement pattern. It is therefore possible to

    use back-references in the replacement string.


    *Warning*: Special characters in the acceptation of regular expressions _and_

    json both need to be escaped. For a key, this means, for example, that a

    literal backslash must be escaped for the regular expression language `\\`

    _and_ each of these backslashes must then be escaped for the json encoding:

    `\\\\`. In the replacement string, a literal `$` must be escaped with an

    additional `$` if it is followed by a number (due to the special meaning in

    regular expression replacement strings), while a backslash must be escaped

    (`\\`) due to the special meaning in json.


    *Advice*: To avoid unexpected results, always match terminating backslashes in

    the search pattern and replacement string: if a search pattern ends with a

    backslash, you should also put one in the replacement string, and if the search

    pattern does not include a terminating backslash, then none should be included

    in the replacement string.


    #### Examples explained


    ```json

    "IterationMaps": {
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2022)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\NewTeam",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2020)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\Archives\\Sprints 2020",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path2": "TargetProject\\YetAnotherPath\\Path2",
    },

    "AreaMaps": {
      "^OriginalProject\\\\(DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\Archive\\Descoped\\",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\(?!DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\NewArea\\",
    }

    ```


    - `"^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2022)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\NewTeam",`

      In an iteration path, `OriginalProject\Path1` found at the beginning of the
      path, when followed by `\Sprint 2022`, will be replaced by
      `TargetProject\AnotherPath\NewTeam`.

      `OriginalProject\Path1\Sprint 2022\Sprint 01` will become
      `TargetProject\AnotherPath\NewTeam\Sprint 2022\Sprint 01` but
      `OriginalProject\Path1\Sprint 2020\Sprint 03` will _not_ be transformed by
      this rule.

    - `"^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2020)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\Archives\\Sprints 2020",`

      In an iteration path, `OriginalProject\Path1` found at the beginning of the
      path, when followed by `\Sprint 2020`, will be replaced by
      `TargetProject\AnotherPath\Archives\\Sprints 2020`.

      `OriginalProject\Path1\Sprint 2020\Sprint 01` will become
      `TargetProject\AnotherPath\Archives\Sprint 2020\Sprint 01` but
      `OriginalProject\Path1\Sprint 2021\Sprint 03` will _not_ be transformed by
      this rule.

    - `"^OriginalProject\\\\Path2": "TargetProject\\YetAnotherPath\\Path2",`

      In an iteration path, `OriginalProject\Path2` will be replaced by
      `TargetProject\YetAnotherPath\Path2`.

    - `"^OriginalProject\\\\(DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\Archive\\Descoped\\",`

      In an area path, `OriginalProject\` found at the beginning of the path, when
      followed by either `DescopeThis` or `DescopeThat` will be replaced by `TargetProject\Archive\Descoped\`.

      `OriginalProject\DescopeThis\Area` will be transformed to
      `TargetProject\Archive\Descoped\DescopeThis\Area`.
      `OriginalProject\DescopeThat\Product` will be transformed to
      `TargetProject\Archive\Descoped\DescopeThat\Product`.

    - `"^OriginalProject\\\\(?!DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\NewArea\\",`

      In an area path, `OriginalProject\` found at the beginning of the path will be
      replaced by `TargetProject\NewArea\` unless it is followed by `DescopeThis` or
      `DescopeThat`.

      `OriginalProject\ValidArea\` would be replaced by
      `TargetProject\NewArea\ValidArea\` but `OriginalProject\DescopeThis` would not
      be modified by this rule.

    ### More Complex Regex


    Before your migration starts it will validate that all of the Areas and Iterations from the **Source** work items revisions exist on the **Target**. Any that do not exist will be flagged in the logs and if and the migration will stop just after it outputs a list of the missing nodes.


    Our algorithm that converts the Source nodes to Target nodes processes the [mappings](https://nkdagility.com/learn/azure-devops-migration-tools/Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemMigrationContext/#iteration-maps-and-area-maps) at that time. This means that any valid mapped nodes will never be caught by the `This path is not anchored in the source project` message as they are already altered to be valid.


    > We recently updated the logging for this part of the system to more easily debug both your mappings and to see what they system is doing with the nodes and their current state. You can set `"LogLevel": "Debug"` to see the details.


    To add a mapping, you can follow [the documentation](https://nkdagility.com/learn/azure-devops-migration-tools/Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemMigrationContext/#iteration-maps-and-area-maps) with this being the simplest way:


    ```

    "IterationMaps": {
      "WorkItemMovedFromProjectName\\\\Iteration 1": "TargetProject\\Sprint 1",
    },

    "AreaMaps": {
       "WorkItemMovedFromProjectName\\\\Team 2": "TargetProject\\ProductA\\Team 2",
    }

    ```

    Or you can use regular expressions to match the missing area or iteration paths:


    ```

    "IterationMaps": {
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2022)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\NewTeam",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path1(?=\\\\Sprint 2020)": "TargetProject\\AnotherPath\\Archives\\Sprints 2020",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\Path2": "TargetProject\\YetAnotherPath\\Path2",
    },

    "AreaMaps": {
      "^OriginalProject\\\\(DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\Archive\\Descoped\\",
      "^OriginalProject\\\\(?!DescopeThis|DescopeThat)": "TargetProject\\NewArea\\",
    }

    ```


    If you want to use the matches in the replacement you can use the following:


    ```

    "IterationMaps": {
      "^\\\\oldproject1(?:\\\\([^\\\\]+))?\\\\([^\\\\]+)$": "TargetProject\\Q1\$2",
    }

    ```

    If the olf iteration path was `\oldproject1\Custom Reporting\Sprint 13`, then this would result in a match for each Iteration node after the project node. You would then be able to reference any of the nodes using "$" and then the number of the match.



    Regular expressions are much more difficult to build and debug so it is a good idea to use a [regular expression tester](https://regex101.com/) to check that you are matching the right things and to build them in ChatGTP.


    _NOTE: You need `\\` to escape a `\` the pattern, and `\\` to escape a `\` in JSON. Therefor on the left of the match you need 4 `\` to represent the `\\` for the pattern and only 2 `\` in the match_ 


    ![image](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/assets/5205575/2cf50929-7ea9-4a71-beab-dd8ff3b5b2a8)


    ## More Complex Team Migrations

    The above options allow you to bring over a sub-set of the WIs (using the `WIQLQueryBit`) and move their area or iteration path to a default location. However you may wish to do something more complex e.g. re-map the team structure. This can be done with addition of a `FieldMaps` block to configuration in addition to the `NodeBasePaths`.


    Using the above sample structure, if you wanted to map the source project `Team 1`  to target project `Team A` etc. you could add the field map as follows


    A complete list of [FieldMaps](../Reference/v1/FieldMaps/index.md) are available.


    ```
     "FieldMaps": [
       {
          "$type": "FieldValueMapConfig",
          "WorkItemTypeName": "*",
          "sourceField": "System.AreaPath",
          "targetField": "System.AreaPath",
          "defaultValue": "TargetProg",
          "valueMapping": {
            "SampleProj\\Team 1": "TargetProg\\Team A",
            "SampleProj\\Team 2": "TargetProg\\Team B"
            "SampleProj\\Team 3": "TargetProg\\Team C"
          }
        },
      ],

    ```


    > Note: This mappings could also be achieved with other forms of Field mapper e.g. `RegexFieldMapConfig`, but the value mapper as an example is easy to understand

    The `WorkItemMigrationContext` processor is used for migrating work items from one Azure DevOps instance to another. This encompasses a variety of activities:


    1. **Transferring Work Items Between Instances**: The primary purpose of the processor is to transfer work items, including bugs, tasks, user stories, features, and more, from one Azure DevOps instance to another.


    2. **Migrating Work Item History**: The processor can also replicate the entire revision history of work items, providing continuity and maintaining a record of changes.


    3. **Migrating Attachments and Links**: The processor can transfer any attachments or links associated with work items. This includes both external links and internal links to other work items.


    4. **Updating Metadata**: If configured, the processor can update the "Created Date" and "Created By" fields on migrated work items to match the original items in the source instance.


    5. **Filtering Work Items**: The processor can be configured to only migrate certain work items based on their area or iteration paths.


    Overall, the `WorkItemMigrationContext` processor is a comprehensive tool for transferring work items and their associated data and metadata between Azure DevOps instances. It should be used whenever there is a need to move work items between instances while preserving as much information as possible.
