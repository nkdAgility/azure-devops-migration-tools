If you want to perform a bulk edit or a migration then you need to start here. This tool has been tested on updating from 100 to 250,000 work items by its users.

Watch the [Video Overview](https://youtu.be/RCJsST0xBCE) to get started in 30 minutes. This tool is complicated and it's not always easy to discover what you need to do.

## Prerequisits

1. [Install](/setup/installation.md) the tools using your prefered method.
1. Check that you have the required [Permissions](/setup/permissions.md) to run the tools.
1. Get to grips with the [Configuration](./Reference/) to understand how to configure the tool. (you can skip this for now and come back to it later)

## Getting Started

This is going to be a crash course and I really recommend watching [What can go wrong and what can go right with a migration via Azure DevOps](https://youtu.be/3jYFD-6_kZk?si=xxvBoljBWjGAOVuv) and then [Basic Work Item Migration with the Azure DevOps Migration Tools](https://youtu.be/Qt1Ywu_KLrc?si=uEXjLS2pwe244ugV) before you get started! This will prep you for the journey ahead.

### 1. Create a default configuration file

1. Open your [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) in your chosen working folder
2. Run `devopsmigration init --options Basic` to create a default configuration
3. Open `configuration.json` from the current directory

You can now customize the configuration depending on what you need to do. However, a basic config that you can use to migrate from one team project to another with the same process will likely look something like:

```JSON
{% include sampleConfig/configuration-getstarted.json %}
```

The default [TfsWorkItemMigrationProcesor](_reference/reference.processors.tfsworkitemmigrationprocessor.md) processor will perform the following operations:

- Migrate iterations and sprints
- Attachments
- Links including source code. Optionally clone the repositories before starting the migration to have links maintained on the initial pass.

## How to execute configuration.json with minimal adjustments

> Remember to add custom field ['ReflectedWorkItemId'](server-configuration.md) to only the target team project before starting migration!

> [NOTE!]
> In older versions of the tool we updated the Source work items with a link back to the Target to make migration easier. This has been removed and replaced with the `FilterWorkItemsThatAlreadyExistInTarget` option instead. **You do not need to add the reflected work item ID custom field to the Source environment.**

1. Adjust the value of the `Collection` attribute for Source and Target
2. Adjust the value of the `Project` attribute for Source and Target
3. Set the `AuthenticationMode` (`Prompt` or `AccessToken`) for Source and Target

   If you set Authentication mode to `AccessToken`, enter a valid PAT as value
   for the `PersonalAccessToken` attribute, or set the
   `PersonalAccessTokenVariableName` to the name of an environment variable containing your PAT.

4. Adjust the value of the `ReflectedWorkItemIdField` attribute (field name of the migration tracking field) for Source and Target

   For example: `TfsMigrationTool.ReflectedWorkItemId` for TFS, `ReflectedWorkItemId` for VSTS, or `Custom.ReflectedWorkItemId` for Azure DevOps

5. Enable the `WorkItemMigrationConfig` processor by setting `Enabled` to `true`
6. [OPTIONAL] Modify the `WIQLQueryBit` to migrate only the work items you want. The default WIQL will migrate all open work items and revisions excluding test suites and plans
7. Adjust the [`NodeBasePaths`](/docs/Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemMigrationConfig.md) or leave empty to migrate all nodes
8. From your working folder run `devopsmigration execute --config .\configuration.json`

**Remember:** If you want a processor to run, its `Enabled` attribute must be set to `true`.

Refer to the [Reference Guide](/docs/Reference/index.md) for more details.

## Other Configuration Options

When running `devopsmigration init` you can also pass `--options` with one of the following:

- _Full_ -
- _WorkItemTracking_ -
- _Fullv2_ -
- _WorkItemTrackingv2_ -
