[![Chocolatey](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/dt/vsts-sync-migrator.svg)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migration.svg)](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/releases) ![Build on VSTS](https://nkdagility.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/1b52ce63-eccc-41c8-88f9-ae6ebeefdc63/94/badge) 

The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the  [documentation](https://nkdagility.com/docs/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a [Azure DevOps Migration Tools on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/).

## What can you do with this tool?

- Migrate `Work Items`, `TestPlans & Suits`, `Teams`, `Shared Queries`, & `Pipelines` from one `Team Project` to another
- Migrate `Work Items`, `TestPlans & Suits`, `Teams`, `Shared Queries`, & `Pipelines` from one `Organisation` to another
- Bulk edit of `Work Items` across an entire `Project`.

### What versions of Azure DevOps & TFS do you support?

- Work Item Migration Supports all versions of TFS 2013+ and all versions of Azure DevOps (Many tools also work all the way back to TFS 2010 but are not supported)
- You can move from any Tfs/AzureDevOps source to any Tfs/AzureDevOps target.
- Process Template migration only supports XML based Projects

### Typical Uses of this tool

- Merge many projects into a single project
- Split one project into many projects
- Assistance in changing Process Templates
- Bulk edit of Work Items
- Migration of Test Suites & Test Plans
- _new_ Migration of Builds & Pipelines
- Migrate from one Language version of TFS / Azure Devops to another (*new v9.0*)

**NOTE: If you are able to migrate your entire Collection to Azure DevOps Services you should use [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/migrate/) from Microsoft. If you have a requirement to change Process Template then you will need to do that before you move t

## Processors (v1 Architecture)

There are a number processors that can be used to migrate, or process, different sorts of data in different ways. Which one is right for you depends on the situation at hand. 
Most of these processors need to be run in order. If you try to migrate work items before you have migrated Area and Iterations then ***bang*** you need to go back.

| Processors | Status | Target    | Usage                              |
|------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| [CreateTeamFolders](Reference/v1/Processors/CreateTeamFolders.md) | alpha | Shared Queries | Creates folders in Sared Queries for each Team |
| [ExportProfilePictureFromADContext](Reference/v1/Processors/ExportProfilePictureFromADContext.md) | alpha | Profiles | Downloads corporate images and updates TFS/Azure DevOps profiles |
| [ExportTeamList](Reference/v1/Processors/ExportTeamList.md) | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments |
| [FakeProcessor](Reference/v1/Processors/FakeProcessor.md) | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments | Note: this is only for internal usage. Don't use this in your configurations. |
| [FixGitCommitLinks](Reference/v1/Processors/FixGitCommitLinks.md) | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments |
| [ImportProfilePictureContext](Reference/v1/Processors/ImportProfilePictureContext.md) | alpha | Profiles | Downloads corporate images and updates TFS/Azure DevOps profiles |
| [TeamMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/TeamMigrationContext.md) | preview | Teams | Migrates Teams and Team Settings: This should be run after `NodeStructuresMigrationConfig` and before all other processors. |
| [TestConfigurationsMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/TestConfigurationsMigrationContext.md) | Beta | Suites & Plans | This processor can migrate `test configuration`. This should be run before `LinkMigrationConfig`. |
| [TestPlansAndSuitesMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/TestPlansAndSuitesMigrationContext.md) | Beta | Suites & Plans | Rebuilds Suits and plans for Test Cases migrated using the WorkItemMigration |
| [TestVariablesMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/TestVariablesMigrationContext.md) | Beta | Suites & Plans | This processor can migrate test variables that are defined in the test plans / suites. This must run before `TestPlansAndSuitesMigrationConfig`. |
| [WorkItemDelete](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemDelete.md) | ready | WorkItem | The `WorkItemDelete` processor allows you to delete any amount of work items that meet the query. **DANGER:** This is not a recoverable action and should be use with extream caution. |
| [WorkItemMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemMigrationContext.md) | ready | Work Items | WorkItemMigrationConfig is the main processor used to Migrate Work Items, Links, and Attachments. Use `WorkItemMigrationConfig` to configure. |
| [WorkItemPostProcessingContext](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemPostProcessingContext.md) | preview | Work Items | Reapply field mappings after a migration. Does not migtate Work Items, only reapplied changes to filed mappings. |
| [WorkItemQueryMigrationContext](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemQueryMigrationContext.md) | preview | Shared Queries | This processor can migrate queries for work items. Only shared queries are included. Personal queries can't migrate with this tool. |
| [WorkItemUpdate](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemUpdate.md) | missng XML code comments | WorkItem | This processor allows you to make changes in place where we load from teh Target and update the Target. This is used for bulk updates with the most common reason being a process template change. |
| [WorkItemUpdateAreasAsTagsContext](Reference/v1/Processors/WorkItemUpdateAreasAsTagsContext.md) | Beta | Work Item | A common issue with older *TFS/Azure DevOps* instances is the proliferation of `Area Paths`. With the use of `Area Path` for `Teams` and the addition of the `Node Name` column option these extensive tag hierarchies should instad be moved to tags. |

## Processors (v2 Architecture) [ PREVIEW ]

**_These are experimental processors that should replace those above. We are interested in feedback of the new format of the config, as well as the functionality._**

The new processor configuration is designed to allow the Migration Tools to support different Source and targets than just TFS/Azure DevOps, and we moved the Endpoints to the processor to allow both Object Model & REST in different processors.

| Processors | Status | Target    | Usage                              |
|------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| [AzureDevOpsPipelineProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/AzureDevOpsPipelineProcessor.md) | Beta | Pipelines | Azure DevOps Processor that migrates Taskgroups, Build- and Release Pipelines. |
| [ProcessDefinitionProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/ProcessDefinitionProcessor.md) | Beta | Pipelines | Process definition processor used to keep processes between two orgs in sync |
| [TfsAreaAndIterationProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/TfsAreaAndIterationProcessor.md) | Beta | Work Items | The `TfsAreaAndIterationProcessor` migrates all of the Area nd Iteraion paths. |
| [TfsSharedQueryProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/TfsSharedQueryProcessor.md) | Beta | Queries | The TfsSharedQueryProcessor enabled you to migrate queries from one locatio nto another. |
| [TfsTeamSettingsProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/TfsTeamSettingsProcessor.md) | Beta | Teams | Native TFS Processor, does not work with any other Endpoints. |
| [WorkItemTrackingProcessor](Reference/v2/Processors/WorkItemTrackingProcessor.md) | missng XML code comments | missng XML code comments | This processor is intended, with the aid of [ProcessorEnrichers](../ProcessorEnrichers/index.md), to allow the migration of Work Items between two [Endpoints](../Endpoints/index.md). |

## Field Maps

By default, when you are moving from source to target the system will map all of the fields that exist in source to the same field in the target. This is the behavior if the **FieldMaps** section is not present in the configuration file.  

However sometimes you want to move data to another field, or use a regex to parse out just the bits that you want. To help we have built a number of mapping tools that should give you the versatility you need.

| FieldMaps | Status | Target    | Usage                              |
|------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| [FieldClearMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldClearMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item | Allows you to set an already populated field to Null. This will only work with fields that support null. |
| [FieldLiteralMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldLiteralMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Sets a field on the `target` to b a specific value. |
| [FieldMergeMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldMergeMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Ever wanted to merge two or three fields? This mapping will let you do just that. |
| [FieldSkipMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldSkipMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item | Allows you to skip populating an existing field. Value in target with be reset to its OriginalValue. |
| [FieldtoFieldMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldtoFieldMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Just want to map one field to another? This is the one for you. |
| [FieldtoFieldMultiMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldtoFieldMultiMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Want to setup a bunch of field maps in a single go. Use this shortcut! |
| [FieldtoTagMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldtoTagMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Want to take a field and convert its value to a tag? Done... |
| [FieldValueMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldValueMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Need to map not just the field but also values? This is the default value mapper. |
| [FieldValuetoTagMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/FieldValuetoTagMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Need to create a Tag based on a field value? Just create a regex match and choose how to populate the target. |
| [MultiValueConditionalMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/MultiValueConditionalMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | ??? If you know how to use this please send a PR :) |
| [RegexFieldMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/RegexFieldMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | I just need that bit of a field... need to send "2016.2" to two fields, one for year and one for release? Done. |
| [TreeToTagMapConfig](Reference/v1/FieldMaps/TreeToTagMapConfig.md) | ready | Work Item Field | Need to clear out those nasty Area tree hierarchies? This creates Tags for each node in the Area Path... |

## Code (TFVC)

There are no good tools for migrating TFVC code. All of them suffer from "time-dilation" as one can't control the dates of the Check-ins. While you can use tools like TaskTop, TFS Integration Tools, or others there is no support. We prefer to recommend that you use Git-TFS and migrate from TFVC to Git with full history and branches. If your resulting repository is too large we recommend creating a full clone of TFVC for posterity, and then create a limited branch clone with limited history for work.

## Code (Git)

When moving Git repos between Projects and Accounts you are able to maintain full history. However you will need to have all of the links to 

* **FixGitCommitLinks** - (obsolete) [this is now fixed on the fly if git is migrated first) Allows you to fix the migrated Git commit hooks (and thus external links) to point to the new repository in the target project. If the source and target repository names are the same, this will work out of the box. If the target repository has a different name, you can specify that name via the "TargetRepository" property.

## Build & Releases

When you import a build or release definition into Azure DevOps you need to fill out some of the data to allow that new definition to be saved. Things like connections and other require fields usually don't have matching GUIDS and need manual intervention. For builds & Releases we recommend that you use the built in Export/Import tools provided in the UI to move then to a new Team Project.

## Why does this exist
The main migration tool for TFS has always been the TFS Integration Tools which is sadly no longer supported. Indeed it only loosely supported versions of TFS after 2010 and had a lot of bugs. It was very difficult to configure and run. This tool hopes to solve some of that by providing support for TFS 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

It solves:

 * Supports all currently supported version of TFS
 * Supports Azure DevOps Services 
 * Migrates work items from one instance of TFS or Azure DevOps to another
 * Bulk edits fields in place for both TFS and Azure DevOps Services
 * Being able to migrate Test Plans an Suits from one Team Project to another
 * Being able to migrate Teams from one Team Project to another
