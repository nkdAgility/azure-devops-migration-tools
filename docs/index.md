The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the [documentation](https://nkdagility.com/learn/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a Winget package a `nkdAgility.AzureDevOpsMigrationTools`.

## Compatibility

These tools run on Windows and support connecting to Team Foundation Server 2013+, Azure DevOps Server, & Azure DevOps Services. They support both hosted and on-premise instances and can move data between any two.

- Supports all versions of TFS 2013+ and all versions of Azure DevOps.
- You can migrate from any TFS/Azure DevOps source to any TFS/Azure DevOps target.

## What do you get?

- _Move_ Work Items, Test Plans & Suites, and Pipelines between projects, collections, and even organizations.
- _Merge_ multiple projects into a single project even from different organizations.
- _Split_ one project into several projects even between projects, collections, and even organizations.
- _Change_ Process process from Agile to Scrum or any other template.
- _Bulk edit_ Work Items.

## What does this tool do?

For the most part we support moving data between `((Azure DevOps Server | Team Foundation Server | Azure DevOps Services) <=> (Azure DevOps Server | Team Foundation Server | Azure DevOps Services))` for any version greater than 2013.

- `Work Items` (including links and attachments) with custom mappings for fields and types
  - Copy Work Items between locations with history
  - Bulk Edit in place of Work Items (Great for cleaning up data, process template changes)
  - Optionally includes `Teams`, `Shared Queries`
- `Test Plans & Suites`
  - Copy Test Plans & Suites between locations
  - Includes `Configurations`, `Shared Steps`, `Shared Parameters`
- `Pipelines`
  - Copy Pipelines between locations
  - Excludes XAML & Classic Builds & Release
- `Processes`
  - Copy Processes between locations

**Note**: 'Locations' includes `Projects`, `Collections`, `Organizations`

**Important:** This tool is intended for experienced users familiar with TFS/Azure DevOps object models and debugging in Visual Studio. It was developed by 100+ contributors from the Azure DevOps community to handle various scenarios and edge cases. _Not all cases are supported_.

**Support Options:** Community support is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/discussions). For paid support, consider our [Azure DevOps Migration Services](https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/azure-devops-migration-services/).

## Metrics (v16+ experimental)

These metrics come directly from Custom Metrics in Application Insights and are updated every 10 minutes. They are experimental and may not be accurate yet... once I get more data I'll tweak both the collection and rendering.

| Metric          | Category   | Type  | All                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | v16                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Notes                                                   |

![Work Items in last 30 days](https://migrationtoolstelemetery.azurewebsites.net/api/GetGraphWorkItemMetrics_WorkItems?code=github)

This tool uses OpenTelemetery to collect metrics and logs, and Application Insights to store and analyse them. Exceptions are also sent to [Elmah.io](https://elmah.io) for analysis and improvement.

## Processors

{% include content-collection-table.html collection = "reference" typeName = "Processors" %}

## Field Maps

By default, when you are moving from source to target the system will map all of the fields that exist in source to the same field in the target. This is the behavior if the **FieldMaps** section is not present in the configuration file.

However sometimes you want to move data to another field, or use a regex to parse out just the bits that you want. To help we have built a number of mapping tools that should give you the versatility you need.

{% include content-collection-table.html collection = "reference" typeName = "FieldMaps" %}

## Why does this exist

The main migration tool for TFS has always been the TFS Integration Tools which is sadly no longer supported. Indeed it only loosely supported versions of TFS after 2010 and had a lot of bugs. It was very difficult to configure and run. This tool hopes to solve some of that by providing support for TFS 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

It solves:

- Supports all currently supported version of TFS
- Supports Azure DevOps Services
- Migrates work items from one instance of TFS or Azure DevOps to another
- Bulk edits fields in place for both TFS and Azure DevOps Services
- Being able to migrate Test Plans an Suites from one Team Project to another
- Being able to migrate Teams from one Team Project to another
