# Work item migration config

WorkItemMigrationConfig is the main processor used to Migrate Work Items, Links, & Attachments

## Features

- Restart will skip completed work items in Tip, and will filter completed revisions in replay.

## Params

| Parameter name                            | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Default Value                                                                |

The Work Item queries are all built using Work Item [Query Language (WIQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax). 

> Note: A useful Azure DevOps Extension to explore WIQL is the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor)

### Examples

You can use the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor) to craft a query in Azure DevOps.

Typical way that queries are built:

```
 var targetQuery = 
     string.Format(
         @"SELECT [System.Id], [{ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName}] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.TeamProject] = @TeamProject {WIQLQueryBit} ORDER BY {WIQLOrderBit}",
         Engine.Target.Config.ReflectedWorkItemIDFieldName,
         _config.WIQLQueryBit,
         _config.WIQLOrderBit
      );
var targetFoundItems = Engine.Target.WorkItems.GetWorkItems(targetQuery);
```

A simple example config:

```
"WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",
"WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",
```
Scope to Area Path (Team data):

```
"WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",
"WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",
```

```
"WIQLQueryBit": "AND [System.ChangedDate] > 'project\Team 1\' AND [System.WorkItemType] NOT IN ('Test Suite', 'Test Plan')",
"WIQLOrderBit": "[System.ChangedDate] desc",
```

## <a name="NodeBasePath"></a>NodeBasePath Configuration ## 
The `NodeBasePaths` entry allows the filtering of the nodes to be replicated on the target projects. To try to explain the correct usage let us assume that we have a source team project `SourceProj` with the following node structures

- AreaPath
   - SourceProj
   - SourceProj\Team 1
   - SourceProj\Team 2
   - SourceProj\Team 3
- IterationPath
   - SourceProj
   - SourceProj\Sprint 1
   - SourceProj\Sprint 2
   - SourceProj\Sprint 3

Depending upon what node structures you wish to migrate you would need the following settings. Example are

| Migration Option                                                                   | NodeBasePath         | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Migrate all areas and iterations and all WI                                        | []                   | The same AreaPath and Iteration Paths are created on the target as on the source. Hence, all migrated WI remain in their existing area and iteration paths                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| To only migrate area path `Team 2` and it's associated WI, but all iteration paths | [ "Team 2, "Sprint"] | Only the area path ending `Team 2` will be migrated. <br>The `WIQLQueryBit` should be edited to limit the WI migrated to this area path e.g. add `AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'SampleProject\\Team 2'` . <br> The migrated WI will have an area path of `TargetProj\Team 2` but retain their iteration paths matching the sprint name on the source |
| Only migrate iterations structure                                                  | [ "Sprint"]          | Only the area path ending `Team 2` will be migrated<br>All the iteration paths will be migrated. <br> The migrated WI will have the default area path of `TargetProj` as their source area path was not migrated i.e. `TargetProj`<br> The migrated WI will have an iteration path match the sprint name on the source                              |
| Move all WI to the existing area and iteration paths on the targetProj             | ["DUMMY VALUE"]      | As the `NodeBasePath` does not match any source area or iteration path no nodes are migrated. <br>Migrated WI will be assigned to any matching area or iteration paths. If no matching ones can be found they will default to the respective root values                                                                                            |

## More Complex Team Migrations
The above options allow you to bring over a sub-set of the WIs (using the `WIQLQueryBit`) and move their area or iteration path to a default location. However you may wish to do something more complex e.g. re-map the team structure. This can be done with addition of a `FieldMaps` block to configuration in addition to the `NodeBasePaths`.

Using the above sample structure, if you wanted to map the source project `Team 1`  to target project `Team A` etc. you could add the field map as follows

```
 "FieldMaps": [
   {
      "$type": "FieldValueMapConfig",
      "WorkItemTypeName": "*",
      "sourceField": "System.AreaPath",
      "targetField": "System.AreaPath",
      "defaultValue": "TargetProg",
      "valueMapping": {
        "SampleProj\\Team 1": "TargetProg\\Team A",
        "SampleProj\\Team 2": "TargetProg\\Team B"
        "SampleProj\\Team 3": "TargetProg\\Team C"
      }
    },
  ],

```

> Note: This mappings could also be achieved with other forms of Field mapper e.g. `RegexFieldMapConfig`, but the value mapper as an example is easy to understand
