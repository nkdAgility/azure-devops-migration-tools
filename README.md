# Azure DevOps Migration Tools

The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the  [documentation](https://nkdagility.com/docs/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a Winget package a `nkdAgility.AzureDevOpsMigrationTools`.

## What can you do with this tool?

- Migrate `Work Items`, `Test Plans & Suites`, `Teams`, `Shared Queries`, `Pipelines`, and `Processes` between different `Team Projects` or `Organizations`.
- Perform bulk edits on `Work Items` across an entire `Project`.

**Important:** This tool is intended for experienced users familiar with TFS/Azure DevOps object models and debugging in Visual Studio. It was developed by over 30 contributors from the Azure DevOps community to handle various scenarios and edge cases. 

**Support Options:** Community support is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/discussions). For paid support, consider our [Azure DevOps Migration Services](https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/azure-devops-migration-services/).

### What versions of Azure DevOps & TFS do you support?

- Supports all versions of TFS 2013+ and all versions of Azure DevOps.
- You can migrate from any TFS/Azure DevOps source to any TFS/Azure DevOps target.

### Typical Uses of this tool

- Merge multiple projects into a single project.
- Split one project into several projects.
- Change Process Templates.
- Bulk edit Work Items.
- Migrate Test Suites & Test Plans.
- Migrate Builds & Pipelines (new).
- Migrate between different language versions of TFS/Azure DevOps (new in v9.0).
- Migrate Processes.

**Note:** If you're migrating an entire collection to Azure DevOps Services, consider using Microsoft's [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/migrate/). If you need to change the Process Template, do so before moving to Azure DevOps Services.

## Minimum Permission Requirements

At this time the documented minimum required permissions for running the tools are:

- Account in both the source and target projects with "Project Collection Administrator" rights
- PAT with "full access" for both the Source and the Target

Note: I have been informed by the Azure DevOps product team information that ObjectModel API only works with full scoped PATs, so it won't work with any PAT that has specific scopes. 

### Advanced Unsupported Permission Options

We have seen that the tools may work with less permissions however the following has not been full tested and is not currently supported:

- Project and Team (Read, write, & manage)
- Work Items (Read, Write & Manage)
- Identity (Read & Manage)
- Security (Manage)

If you do try this out then please let us know how you get on!

## Advanced tools

There are additional advanced tooling available on [Azure DevOps Automation Tools](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-automation-tools). These are a collection of Powershell scripts that can be used to;

- Generate Migration Tools configurations across many projects on many organisations
- Export Stats on many projects on many organisations
- Publish Custom fields across many projects on many organisations
- Output the fields and other data for many projects on many organisations

These tools are designed to help you manage migration of Work Items at scale.
